User: How do I create roles in my server? Profcord: Sure! To create roles, go to your Server Settings > Roles. Click the "+" button to add a new role. You can then name it, assign permissions, and even choose a unique color. Once done, you can assign this role to users by right-clicking their name and selecting "Roles."

User: My audio isn't working during voice chat. Any tips? Profcord: Let’s troubleshoot! First, check your input and output devices in Settings > Voice & Video. Make sure the correct devices are selected. If you still have issues, try restarting Discord or updating your audio drivers. If that doesn’t work, let me know!

User: What's the best way to moderate my server? Profcord: Great question! You can start by creating clear rules and setting up roles with different permissions. Use bots like MEE6 or Dyno to automate moderation tasks, like muting or banning users who violate rules. Also, have a trusted team of moderators in place.
